# touchy

I wanted a way to visualize and experiment with musical intervals.

This 
- allows different layouts (I've played with chromatic, guitar layout, isometric with thirds and fifths)
- colors by consonance (blue) or dissonance (red)
- reacts to multitouch
- reacts to MIDI input
- plays to MIDI

An experiment written for [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), because it's very convenient for this sort of thing.


TODO:
- change button behaviour, it reacts twice and is slow
- put code in repository
- add on-screen swapping to other layouts, midi channel, and other such config
- add file config (e.g. for what MIDI device name to prefer)
